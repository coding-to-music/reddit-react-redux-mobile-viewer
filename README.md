## Adding the GitHub Pages dependency package
Next, weâ€™ll install the gh-pages package in our project. The package allows us to publish build files into a gh-pages branch on GitHub, where they can then be hosted.

Install gh-pages as a dev dependency via npm:

```
npm install gh-pages --save-dev
```
## Adding the deploy scripts
Now, letâ€™s configure the package.json file so that we can point our GitHub repository to the location where our React app will be deployed.

Weâ€™ll also need to add predeploy and deploy scripts to the package.json file. The predeploy script is used to bundle the React application; the deploy script deploys the bundled file.

In the package.json file, add a homepage property that follows this structure: http://{github-username}.github.io/{repo-name}

Now, letâ€™s add the scripts.

In the package.json file, scroll down to the scripts property and add the following commands:

```
"predeploy" : "npm run build",
"deploy" : "gh-pages -d build",
```
